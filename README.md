### How to Contribute

1. **Fork and Clone the Repository**
   - Fork the [PyChess repository](https://github.com/pychess/pychess) to your GitHub profile.
   - Make sure you are in a directory where you are comfortable cloning the PyChess project to!
   - Clone your fork from its remote repository to your local machine using:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/pychess.git
     cd pychess
     ```

2. **Set Up Your Development Environment**
   - Ensure you have Python 3.10 or newer installed.
   - Install the required dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - If it suits your development needs, create a virtual environment to isolate your development environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Running PyChess Locally**
   - To launch PyChess, run the following command from the project root directory:
     ```bash
     python pychess
     ```
   - Using the launched instance, you can monitor and reflect upon any changes you make.

4. **Understanding the Codebase**
   - The PyChess repository is organized into several key directories:
     - `pychess/`: Contains the core game logic and main application code.
     - `lib/`: Includes various helper libraries and associated utilities that the project depends upon.
     - `boards/`, `pieces/`: Assets and resources dealing with the chess board and pieces.
     - `docs/`: Project documentation files. Here, you can improve and contribute to other pieces of documentation.
     - `testing/`: Tests for various components of PyChess.
   - Be sure to understand this organizational structure so that you can effectively contribute to it.

5. **Writing and Running Tests**
   - It is imperative to test any code you intend on deploying. Be sure to take any edge cases into account!
   - PyChess uses `pytest` for testing. To run the test suite, execute:
     ```bash
     pytest
     ```
   - Any of the tests you use should be stored in testing/. This ensures adequate testing coverage of the entire project.

6. **Submitting a Pull Request**

   - Create a new branch for your changes:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature-name
     ```
   - Add and commit your changes (be sure to use a helpful and informative message in your commit):
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Added x, y, z"
     ```
   - Push the branch to your fork and then create a pull request to the PyChess repository. Be sure to raise the PR to PyChess' main branch.
